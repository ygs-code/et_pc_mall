      <!-- <p class="main-title">Our Story</p>
            <p class="main-content">
                The idea for Amba Homes was born out of our own challenges with online shopping. As everyday consumers,
                we were frustrated by products that didn't match expectations, long wait times, and the lack of personal
                touch that makes shopping enjoyable. We realized there was a gap in the market for an e-commerce
                platform that offered more than just fast delivery or a wide range of products. We wanted to create a
                store that prioritizes:
            </p>
            <ul class="ul-list">
                <li class="item" v-for="(item, index) in ulList" :key="index">
                    <i class="dot"></i>
                    <span class="item-text">{{ item.text }}</span>
                </li>
            </ul> -->
      <p class="main-title">1. Shipping Methods and Costs</p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        We offer a range of shipping options to suit your needs:

        sooner.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Shipping costs are calculated at checkout based on your delivery
        location, the size of your order, and the shipping method you select.
