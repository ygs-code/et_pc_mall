                Thank you for shopping with Amba Homes. We are committed to providing you with high-quality products and
                a seamless shopping experience. Our shipping policy outlines the details regarding the shipping of

            <!-- <p class="main-title">1. Shipping Locations</p>
            <p class="main-content">
                The idea for Amba Homes was born out of our own challenges with online shopping. As everyday consumers,
                we were frustrated by products that didn't match expectations, long wait times, and the lack of personal
                touch that makes shopping enjoyable. We realized there was a gap in the market for an e-commerce
                platform that offered more than just fast delivery or a wide range of products. We wanted to create a
                store that prioritizes:
            </p>
            <ul class="ul-list">
                <li class="item" v-for="(item, index) in ulList" :key="index">
                    <i class="dot"></i>
                    <span class="item-text">{{ item.text }}</span>
                </li>
            </ul> -->
            <p class="main-title">1. Shipping Locations</p>
            <p class="main-content">
                We offer delivering our products across all states and major cities in India. While we strive to deliver
                to every corner of the country, certain remote areas may experience longer delivery times or may not be
                covered by our shipping partners. If your address is in a remote location, our team will reach out to
                you with further details.

            <p class="mb-6">Important: If the courier service is unable to deliver your package due to an incorrect
                address, or if the delivery is returned to us, you will be responsible for additional shipping costs to
